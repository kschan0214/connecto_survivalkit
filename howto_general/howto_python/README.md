# howto_python

The Martinos Center provides a guide to set up Python in the server environment. You can follow the [guide](https://it.martinos.org/help/python/) for a fresh start if you want.

Alternatively, if you don't want to set up Miniforge yourself, you may simply source [my shell script](initiate_conda.sh):

```bash
source /autofs/space/linen_001/users/kwokshing/tools/connecto_survivalkit/howto_general/howto_python/initiate_conda.sh
```

then you can use the conda function as usual including creating a new conda environment etc.
