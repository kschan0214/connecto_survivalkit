# howto_connecto/howto_TractSeg

This document is for people who want to use TractSeg for their analysis.

I have set up the conda environment to use [TractSeg](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/TractSeg) in our server. 

You can initiate TractSeg using my shell script:

``source initiate_TractSeg.sh``

which will activate the virtual environment in where TractSeg is installed. 

I also provide two examples scripts here to demonstrate it usage in our server setup:

1. [run_example_01_tractseg_subject.sh](run_example_01_tractseg_subject.sh) shows the usage of tract segmentation

2. [run_example_02_tractometry_subject.sh](run_example_02_tractometry_subject.sh) shows the usage of running Tractometer
